        <h1>Mass Panic Continues, Although This Time, It's Not Because Of Sight Reading</h1>
    </header>

    <p class="lead">Panic in the CRHS Choir Department continues as everybody realizes the "Bravo!" performance
    is now less than a month away...</p>

    <div class="content">
        <p>No folks, this is not a drill. Amidst Monday night's EF-5 tornadoes, each and every one of
        Mr. Kainz's students (aka Dancing Queens) had the realization that "Bravo!"—the upcoming choir performance—is not just a theoretical concept.</p>

        <p>Students from the Alto section were last seen practicing their songs in the hallway while dodging flying sheet music, thanks to the tornadoes. 
        One Alto from Concert Choir, Tennyson, was reportedly spotted dramatically facing the storm, hair whipping in the wind, 
        and yelling</p>

        <blockquote>“Mamma Mia! Here I go again! My, my, how can I resist you?”</blockquote>

        <p>before immediately losing her pitch pipe to the wind.</p>

        <p>Meanwhile, the Tenors are still trying to figure out the high notes in the Senior Song "It's so Hard to Say Goodbye to Yesterday." 
        Rumor has it one of them did hit the note—but only after accidentally tripping on the risers.</p>

        <p>During the storm, one Soprano was heard singing "It's Timeeeeee!" before opening up to the second page of "Bruce Phelps Sight Reading Manual Volume I."
        Witnesses say she claimed she saw her life flash before her eyes after seeing double accidentals. Oops!</p>
        
        <p>Despite the madness, hope remains. And just remember, if you make a mistake while singing, as Mr. Kainz always says,</p>

        <blockquote>“It Builds Character.”</blockquote>

        <p>Even after the treacherous storm, Mr. Kainz's Dancing Queens haven't lost hope. But their sense of humor for Joke Wednesday? Well, let's just say it's been "blown away."</p>

        <p>As per usual, Mr. Kainz was unavailable for comment at the time of publication. All we know is during the storm, he was heard saying</p>

        <blockquote>“Well, that is a <b>major scale</b> disaster!”</blockquote>

        <p>In the meantime, the CRHS Choir has continued to do extraordinary work on their songs. And with "Bravo!" only a month away, if there's one thing choir students do best,
        it's keeping their perfect posture—even in the face of chaos.</p>
