    <p class="lead">As the 2024-25 school year comes to a close and the new year begins, music director Mr. Kainz kicks it off with a <b>sharp</b> start—accidentally.”</p>

    <div class="content">
        <p>Do you hear that? Is that perhaps—the sight reading bird? On Tuesday, October 14th, the entire CRHS Choir Department was greeted with the first of many sight reading
            tests! "It's tradition," said Kainz, smiling maniacally while testing students on short sight reading snippets that can only be described as 'a war crime against rhythm.'<br><br></p>

        <p>In other news, choir robe fittings took place on Monday. While some say it went smoothly (those suffering from a condition known as “pathological lying”), others had… different
            experiences. Kathryn, a Concert Choir Alto, told us, “Because I’m so short, there’s never any robes left for me!” Well, Kathryn, maybe it’s time to invest in a pair of platform Crocs.</p>

        <p>During rehearsals, director Kainz referred to choir ensembles as "Family." He immediately followed that up by yelling at family for "breathing wrong."</p>

        <p>The annual Homecoming Star Spangled Banner event on Friday went phenomenally! Even with the score being 75 to 0, fans insisted it was 'technically a close game
            if you round up.'</p>

        <p>The Friday Song has gone missing! The once-loved tradition that has reminded us time and time again that "We are loved. We are enough. And we are not alone" has vanished with no trace.
            Will this be the end of a decades old tradition?</p>

        <p>With the concert being one month away, it's important now more than ever to practice your music and really get it memorized. Just remember that, with your time—you can spend it—when you
            spend it—then you're running out of time.</p>
