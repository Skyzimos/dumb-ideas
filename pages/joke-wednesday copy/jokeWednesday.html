        <h1>New Sight Reading Packet Causes Mass Panic, Emotional Collapse</h1>
    </header>

    <p class="lead">What started as a regular Tuesday ended in mass panic when Coon Rapids High School Choir Director "Mr. Kainz"
    handed out the "Bruce Phelps Level IV" sight reading packet.</p>

    <div class="content">
        <p>Eyewitnesses report that the moment the packet was distributed, the room instantly dropped 12
        degrees, with one student reportedly asking, "If I pretend to faint, do I still get a participation grade?"</p>

        <p>At this time, we were only able to collect two witness statements, both of which were members of the Tenor section.</p>

        <p>Tenor section member Logan described the experience;</p>

        <blockquote>“I sight read one measure and had to check if I still had a pulse. I’m pretty sure reading it out loud summoned something. Maybe Beethoven? All I can say is I haven’t been the same since.”</blockquote>

        <p>The bass section tried to escape through a side door but tragically, it was locked. When they returned to their seats, Mr. Kainz simply smiled and said, “Page 4,” without question.</p>
        
        <p>Tenor section member Desmond stated in an interview that</p>

        <blockquote>“I’ve been through Bruce Phelps
            Level III. But Level IV? That’s the beginning of the end. I feel like I owe Bruce Phelps money and this packet is how he’s collecting.”</blockquote>

        <p>The school’s counselor’s office confirmed a 700% spike in emergency walk-ins, most clutching the packet and whispering, “I swear the notes are moving.”</p>

        <p>Choir Director Mr. Kainz was unavailable for comment, but was last seen calmly sipping tea out of a mug labeled:</p>

        <blockquote>“It Builds Character.”</blockquote>

        <p>Authorities warn that Bruce Phelps Level V exists — and if the rumors are true, it includes three key changes, singing backwards, and rhythms that don’t even line up, just for funsies.</p>
