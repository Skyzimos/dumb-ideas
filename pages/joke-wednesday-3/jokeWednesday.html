        <h1>Saying Goodbye As The Year Ends, With Memories We’ll Hold Forever</h1>
    </header>

    <p class="lead">The year comes to a close as this year’s “Bravo!” performance ends on a good <strong>note</strong>. (Pun fully intended.)</p>

    <div class="content">
        <p>On Thursday, May 22nd, Coon Rapids High School celebrated a stunning performance during their annual concert, "Bravo!" Witnesses recount audience members yelling “Thank you for the Music!”
        while others were seen wiping away tears after the Senior Song.</p>

        <p>During the song “Dancing Queen,” an unidentified Soprano hit a note so high that one audience member whispered, “Is that legal?”
        (It is. We checked.)</p>

        <p>Tenor Jesse, from Concert Choir, was heard singing the incorrect part for half of "Mamma Mia," even after practicing it so much he could sing it in
        his sleep. Oh well, maybe next time. (But let’s be honest — probably not.)</p>

        <p>The whole night was full of unforgettable moments; a full run-through of “Waterloo” with no issues for the first time in all 18
        rehearsals, a microphone being handed off last-second during “The Winner Takes It All” (accidental, but it looked intentional), a sudden—wait… is this the right script?</p>

        <p>Behind all of the magic the night brought was a bittersweet truth; this marked the final performance for our graduating seniors.</p>

        <p>Choir director Mr. Kainz was overheard backstage saying,</p>
        
        <blockquote>“I’m not crying, you’re crying!<br>It’s probably just stage fog in my eye.”</blockquote>

        <p>Since the concert, things have slowly returned back to normal. Well, as normal as they can get. (Let's be honest, are things ever "back to normal"?)</p>

        <p>All we can say is "Mamma Mia! That performance was amazing!," and "You all are Super Troupers for making it through!"</p>

    <h3>A message from Jesse</h3>
    <p>Because this is likely the last article we'll see this year, I just want to say thank you all for supporting this work. I've attached a message to each choir class below
    to show my appreciation. <3</p>

    <br>

    <p><span class="big">Cantabile;</span> Although many of you I didn’t get to directly speak to this year, I’d just like to say I am so proud of each of you. This year you all
    have grown so much as singers, performers, and just overall, people. Words can't describe how proud I am of you all. You're all so talented! Keep going with choir; I want to see
    you all at "Bravo!" 2026!</p>

    <br>

    <p><span class="big">Bel Canto;</span> Each one of you is an amazing person, friend, and leader. You should all be so proud of yourselves this year for all you did. Even when
    it was difficult, you still gave it your best. It's been so fun getting to see all of your performances, and I can't wait to see where the future takes you! I'm excited to sing
    with you all next year!</p>

    <br>

    <p><span class="big">Concert Choir;</span> I just want to thank you all. While I’m writing this, I’m having issues trying to think of what to say because, well, what do you say?
    Getting to know you all has been such a pleasure, and although I'm sad to see many of you leaving, I know you'll all do so well at whatever you'll be doing next. I hope to see all
    of you in the near future! And to those returning next year, I can’t wait to make even more memories with you. Anyway, again, thank you for everything. You've all made this year unforgettable!</p>

    <p>Have a great summer, people!</p>
